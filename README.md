# nth

Fast and memory efficient implementation of a Selection Algorithm in Go.

**Note:** This is not ready for use yet. The plan is to implement in order
Naive, QuickSelect, MedianOfMedian, IntroSelect. The planned interface is
`sort.Interface` and as such will be easy to use. The goal is `O(1)` space and
`O(n)` runtime.
